# UpGrad_Assignment
This is an assignment carried out by me as a part of the intern hiring process for UpGrad. 

Initial reading of the data and Pre-Processing has been carried out in R. I have written the CSV files to local drive. 
I have then read the standardized CSV file in Python and built the models. 

For the Python code, I have added the libraries in separate .ipynb files and I have uploaded them as well.

Along with the Code, I have also uploaded a short Powerpoint Presentation.
